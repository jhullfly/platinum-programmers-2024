    To find this, we first need to consider the total gear reduction powering our arm.
    First, we have an external 20t:100t (5:1) reduction created by two spur gears.
    But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
    The motor we use for this arm is a 117RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
    reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
    We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.
    The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7125.16
    counts per rotation of the arm. We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree. */

            Encoders report when the motor has moved a specified angle. They send out pulses which
            only occur at specific intervals (see our ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE). This means that the
            position our arm is currently at can be expressed as a whole number of encoder "ticks".
            The encoder will never report a partial number of ticks. So we can store the position in
            an integer (or int).
            A lot of the variables we use in FTC are doubles. These can capture fractions of whole
            numbers. Which is great when we want our arm to move to 122.5°, or we want to set our
            servo power to 0.5.

            setTargetPosition is expecting a number of encoder ticks to drive to. Since encoder
            ticks are always whole numbers, it expects an int. But we want to think about our
            arm position in degrees. And we'd like to be able to set it to fractions of a degree.
            So we make our arm positions Doubles. This allows us to precisely multiply together
            armPosition and our armPositionFudgeFactor. But once we're done multiplying these
            variables. We can decide which exact encoder tick we want our motor to go to. We do
            this by "typecasting" our double, into an int. This takes our fractional double and
            rounds it to the nearest whole number.
